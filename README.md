# Legacy Associations and Validations

## Description

Take an existing legacy codebase with no associations or validations and add them.

## Merging

We approached this assignment by creating two branches. One for Danai and one for Jennifer. Jennifer merged her branch into the master branch locally, then pushed the master branch to github. Danai then pulled down the master into his local master to merge. Danai then merged his branch into the master branch and made the edits. Danai then pushed the master to github.

## Program comments
After merging we failed four tests, which we believe has something to do with the merged files. Danai has some trouble with a couple files before the merge so some may be caryover.

Overall a rather difficult assignment. Gets very complicated once you merge the files together. Hardest part of this assignment for me (Danai) was applying the new material. Once things started to click things became easier but I had a lot of no message given errors in which im not sure why they were given.
